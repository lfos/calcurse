CALCURSE - text-based organizer
===============================

Abstract
--------

This manual describes `calcurse` functionalities, and how to use them. The
installation from source is first described, together with the available
command line arguments. The user interface is then presented, with all of the
customizable options that change `calcurse` behavior. Last, bug reporting
procedure is explained, as well as the way one can contribute to `calcurse`
development.

Introduction
------------

`calcurse` is a text-based calendar and scheduling application. It helps
keeping track of events, appointments and everyday tasks.  A configurable
notification system reminds user of upcoming deadlines, and the curses based
interface can be customized to suit user needs.  All of the commands are
documented within an online help system.

Overview
--------

Creation history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Frederic started thinking about this project when he was finishing his Ph.D. in
Astrophysics as it started to be a little hard to organize himself and he
really needed a good tool for managing his appointments and todo list.
Unfortunately, he finished his Ph.D. before finishing `calcurse` but he
continued working on it, hoping it would be helpful to other people.

In mid-2010, Lukas took over development of `calcurse` and is now the main
contributor and reviewer of patches.

But why `calcurse` anyway?  Well, it is simply the concatenation of *cal*endar
and *curse*s, the name of the library used to build the user interface.

Important features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Calcurse` is multi-platform and intended to be lightweight, fast and reliable.
It is to be used inside a console or terminal, locally or on a distant machine
within an ssh (or similar) connection.

`Calcurse` can be run in two different modes : interactive or non-interactive
mode. The first mode allows oneself to view its own personal organizer almost
everywhere, thanks to the text-based interface.  The second mode permits to
easily build reminders just by adding `calcurse` with appropriate command line
arguments inside a cron tab or within a shell init script.

Moreover, `calcurse` was created with the end-user in mind, and tends to be as
friendly as possible. This means a complete on-line help system, together with
having all of the possible actions displayed at any time inside a status bar.
The user interface is configurable, and one can choose between several color
and layout combinations.  Key bindings are also configurable, to fit everyone's
needs.  Last, a configurable notification system reminds user of upcoming
appointments. The reminders are sent even if the user's interface is not
running, as calcurse is able to run in background.

Installation
------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

ncurses library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Calcurse` requires only a `C` compiler, such as `cc` or `gcc`, and the
`ncurses` library.  It would be very surprising not to have a valid `ncurses`
library already installed on your computer, but if not, you can find it at the
following url: http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/

NOTE: It is also possible to link `calcurse` against the `ncursesw` library
      (ncurses with support for unicode).

[[install_requirements_gettext]]
gettext library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`calcurse` supports internationalization (*i18n* hereafter) through the
`gettext` utilities. This means `calcurse` can produce multi-lingual messages
if compiled with native language support (i.e. *NLS*).

However, *NLS* is optional and if you do not want to have support for
multi-lingual messages, you can disable this feature.  This is done by giving
the `--disable-nls` option to `configure` (see section
<<install_process,Install process>>).  To check if the `gettext` utilities are
installed on your system, you can search for the `libintl.h` header file for
instance:

----
$ locate libintl.h
----

If this header file is not found, then you can obtain the `gettext` sources at
the following url : http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/

NOTE: Even if `libintl.h` is found on your system, it can be wise to specify
      its location during the <<install_process,install process>>, by using the
      `--with-libintl-prefix` option with `configure`. Indeed, the `configure`
      could fail to locate this library if installed in an uncommon place.

[[install_process]]
Install process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you need to gunzip and untar the source archive:

----
$ tar zxvf calcurse-4.8.2.tar.gz
----

Once you meet the requirements and have extracted the archive, the install
process is quite simple, and follows the standard three steps process:

----
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install    # (may require root privilege)
----

Use `./configure --help` to obtain a list of possible options.

calcurse basics
---------------

Invocation
~~~~~~~~~~

[[basics_invocation_commandline]]
Command line arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`calcurse` takes the following options from the command line (both short and
long options are supported):

`-a, --appointment`::
  Print the appointments and events for the current day and exit. Equivalent to
  `-Q --filter-type cal`. The calendar from which to read the  appointments can
  be specified using the `-c` flag.

`-c <file>, --calendar <file>`::
  Specify the calendar file to use. The default calendar is located at
  `<datadir>/apts` (see section <<basics_files,calcurse files>>). This option
  has precedence over `-D`.

`-C <dir>, --directory <dir>`::
  Specify the configuration directory to use. See
  <<basics_files,calcurse files>> for the default directory and for the
  interaction with `-D`.

`-d <date|num>, --day <date|num>`::
  Print the appointments for the given date  or  for  the given  number  of
  upcoming days, depending on the argument format. Two possible formats are
  supported:
+
--
  * a date (possible formats described below).
  * a number `n`.
--
+
In the first  case,  the  appointment  list  for  the specified  date will be
returned, while in the second case the appointment list for the `n`  upcoming
days will be returned.  As an example, typing `calcurse -d  3`  will  display
your  appointments  for  today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.
The first form is equivalent to `-Q --filter-type cal --from <date>`, the
second form is equivalent to `-Q --filter-type cal --days <num>`.
+
Note: as for the `-a` flag, the calendar  from which to  read  the appointments
can be specified using the `-c` flag.

`--daemon`::
  Start calcurse in background mode. Restart if the daemon was already running.
  See <<basics_daemon,Background mode>> for details.

`--days <num>`::
  Specify the length of the range (in days) when used with `-Q`. Cannot be
  combined with `--to`.

`-D <dir>, --directory <dir>`::
  Specify the (data) directory to use. See <<basics_files,calcurse files>> for
  the default directory and for the interaction with `-C`.

`--filter-type <type>`::
  Ignore any items that do not match the type mask. See
  <<basics_filters,Filters>> for details.

`--filter-pattern <pattern>`::
  Ignore any items with a description that does not match the pattern. See
  <<basics_filters,Filters>> for details.

`--filter-start-from <date>`::
  Ignore any items that start before a given date. See
  <<basics_filters,Filters>> for details.

`--filter-start-to <date>`::
  Ignore any items that start after a given date. See
  <<basics_filters,Filters>> for details.

`--filter-start-after <date>`::
  Only include items that start after a given date. See
  <<basics_filters,Filters>> for details.

`--filter-start-before <date>`::
  Only include items that start before a given date. See
  <<basics_filters,Filters>> for details.

`--filter-start-range <range>`::
  Only include items within a given range. See <<basics_filters,Filters>> for
  details.

`--filter-end-from <date>`::
  Ignore any items that end before a given date. See <<basics_filters,Filters>>
  for details.

`--filter-end-to <date>`::
  Ignore any items that end after a given date. See <<basics_filters,Filters>>
  for details.

`--filter-end-after <date>`::
  Only include items that end after a given date. See
  <<basics_filters,Filters>> for details.

`--filter-end-before <date>`::
  Only include items that end before a given date. See
  <<basics_filters,Filters>> for details.

`--filter-end-range <range>`::
  Only include items within a given range. See <<basics_filters,Filters>> for
  details.

`--filter-priority <priority>`::
  Only include items with a given priority. See <<basics_filters,Filters>> for
  details.

`--filter-completed`::
  Only include completed TODO items. See <<basics_filters,Filters>> for
  details.

`--filter-uncompleted`::
  Only include uncompleted TODO items. See <<basics_filters,Filters>> for
  details.

`--format-apt <format>`::
  Specify a format to control the output of appointments in non-interactive
  mode. See the <<basics_format_strings,Format strings>> section for detailed
  information on format strings.

`--format-recur-apt <format>`::
  Specify a format to control the output of recurrent appointments in
  non-interactive mode. See the <<basics_format_strings,Format strings>>
  section for detailed information on format strings.

`--format-event <format>`::
  Specify a format to control the output of events in non-interactive mode. See
  the <<basics_format_strings,Format strings>> section for detailed information
  on format strings.

`--format-recur-event <format>`::
  Specify a format to control the output of recurrent events in non-interactive
  mode. See the <<basics_format_strings,Format strings>> section for detailed
  information on format strings.

`--format-todo <format>`::
  Specify a format to control the output of todo items in non-interactive mode.
  See the <<basics_format_strings,Format strings>> section for detailed
  information on format strings.

`--export-uid`::
  When exporting items, add the hash of each item to the exported object as a
  UID property.

`-F`, `--filter`::
  Read items from the data files and write them back. The filter interface can
  be used to drop specific items. Be careful with this option, specifying a
  wrong filter might result it data loss! It is highly recommended to test the
  effect of filters with -G first. See also: <<basics_filters,Filters>>.

`--from <date>`::
  Specify the start date of the range when used with `-Q`.

`-g, --gc`::
  Run the garbage collector for note files and exit.

`-G, --grep`::
  Print appointments and TODO items using the calcurse data file format. The
  filter interface can be used to further restrict the output. See also:
  <<basics_filters,Filters>>.

`-h, --help`::
  Print  a  short  help  text  describing  the  supported command-line options,
  and exit.

`-i <file>, --import <file>`::
  Import the icalendar data contained in `file`.

`-l <num>, --limit <num>`::
  Limit the number of results printed to 'num'.

`--dump-imported`::
  When importing items, print each newly created object to stdout. Format
  strings can be used to specify which details are printed. See also:
  <<basics_format_strings,Format strings>>.

`-n, --next`::
  Print the next appointment within upcoming 24 hours and exit.  The indicated
  time is the number of hours and minutes left before this appointment.
+
Note: the calendar from which to read the appointments can be specified using
the `-c` flag.

`-q`, `--quiet`::
  Be quiet. Do not show system dialogs.

`-Q, --query`::
  Print all appointments inside a given query range, followed by all TODO
  items. The query range defaults to the current day and can be changed by
  using the `--from` and `--to` (or `--days`) parameters. The filter interface
  can be used to further restrict the output. See also:
  <<basics_filters,Filters>>.

`-r[num], --range[=num]`::
  Print events and appointments for the num number of days and exit. If no num
  is given, a range of 1 day is considered. Equivalent to `-Q --filter-type cal
  --days <num>`.

`--read-only`::
  Don't save configuration nor appointments/todos.
+
WARNING: Use this this with care! If you run an interactive calcurse instance
in read-only mode, all changes from this session will be lost without warning!

`-s[date], --startday[=date]`::
  Print  events  and appointments from date and exit.  If no date is given, the
  current day is considered. Equivalent to `-Q --filter-type cal --from
  <date>`.

`-S<regex>, --search=<regex>`::
  When used with the `-a`, `-d`, `-r`, `-s`, or `-t` flag, print only the items
  having a description that matches the given regular expression. Equivalent to
  `-Q --filter-pattern <regex>`.

`--status`::
  Display  the  status of running instances of calcurse. If calcurse is
  running, this will tell  if  the  interactive mode  was  launched  or  if
  calcurse is running in background.  The process pid will also be indicated.

`-t[num], --todo[=num]`::
  Print the `todo` list and exit. If the optional number `num` is given, then
  only uncompleted todos having a priority equal to `num` will be returned. The
  priority number must be between 1 (highest) and 9 (lowest). It is also
  possible to specify `0` for the priority, in which case only completed tasks
  will be shown. Equivalent to `-Q --filter-type todo`, combined with
  `--filter-priority` and `--filter-completed` or `--filter-uncompleted`.

`--to <date>`::
  Specify the end date of the range when used with `-Q`. Cannot be combined
  with `--days`.

`-v, --version`::
  Display `calcurse` version and exit.

`-x[format], --export[=format]`::
  Export user data to specified format. Events, appointments and todos are
  converted and echoed to stdout.  Two possible formats are available: ical and
  pcal (see section <<links_others,Links>> below).  If the optional
  argument `format` is not given, ical format is selected by default.
+
Note: redirect standard output to export data to a file, by issuing a command
such as:
+
----
$ calcurse --export > my_data.dat
----

NOTE: The `-N` option has been removed in calcurse 3.0.0. See the
<<basics_format_strings,Format strings>> section on how to print note along
with appointments and events.

[[basics_filters]]
Filters
^^^^^^^

Filters can be used to restrict the set of items which are loaded from the
appointments file when using calcurse in non-interactive mode. The following
filters are currently supported:

`--filter-hash <pattern>`::
  Only include items with a hash starting with the specified pattern. The
  pattern can be inverted by prepending an exclamation mark (`!`).

`--filter-type <type>`::
  Ignore any items that do not match the type mask. The type mask is a
  comma-separated list of valid type descriptions which include `event`, `apt`,
  `recur-event`, `recur-apt` and `todo`. You can also use `recur` as a
  shorthand for `recur-event,recur-apt` and `cal` as a shorthand for
  `event,apt,recur`.

`--filter-pattern <pattern>`::
  Ignore any items with a description that does not match the pattern. The
  pattern is interpreted as extended regular expression.

`--filter-start-from <date>`::
  Ignore any items that start before a given date.

`--filter-start-to <date>`::
  Ignore any items that start after a given date.

`--filter-start-after <date>`::
  Only include items that start after a given date.

`--filter-start-before <date>`::
  Only include items that start before a given date.

`--filter-start-range <range>`::
  Only include items with a start date that falls within a given range. A range
  consists of a start date and an end date, separated by a comma.

`--filter-end-from <date>`::
  Ignore any items that end before a given date.

`--filter-end-to <date>`::
  Ignore any items that end after a given date.

`--filter-end-after <date>`::
  Only include items that end after a given date.

`--filter-end-before <date>`::
  Only include items that end before a given date.

`--filter-end-range <range>`::
  Only include items with an end date that falls within a given range. A range
  consists of a start date and an end date, separated by a comma.

`--filter-priority <priority>`::
  Only include items with a given priority.

`--filter-completed`::
  Only include completed TODO items.

`--filter-uncompleted`::
  Only include uncompleted TODO items.

[[basics_format_strings]]
Format strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Format strings are composed of printf()-style format specifiers -- ordinary
characters are copied to stdout without modification. Each specifier is
introduced by a `%` and is followed by a character which specifies the field to
print. The set of available fields depends on the item type.

Format specifiers for appointments
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`s`::
  Print the start time of the appointment as UNIX time stamp
`S`::
  Print the start time of the appointment using the `hh:mm` format
`d`::
  Print the duration of the appointment in seconds
`e`::
  Print the end time of the appointment as UNIX time stamp
`E`::
  Print the end time of the appointment using the `hh:mm` format
`m`::
  Print the description of the item
`n`::
  Print the name of the note file belonging to the item
`N`::
  Print the note belonging to the item

Format specifiers for events
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`m`::
  Print the description of the item
`n`::
  Print the name of the note file belonging to the item
`N`::
  Print the note belonging to the item

Format specifiers for todo items
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`p`::
  Print the priority of the item
`m`::
  Print the description of the item
`n`::
  Print the name of the note file belonging to the item
`N`::
  Print the note belonging to the item

Examples
++++++++

`calcurse -r7 --format-apt='- %S -> %E\n\t%m\n%N'`::
  Print appointments and events for the next seven days. Also, print the notes
  attached to each regular appointment (simulates `-N` for appointments).

`calcurse -r7 --format-apt=' - %m (%S to %E)\n' --format-recur-apt=' - %m (%S to %E)\n'`::
  Print appointments and events for the next seven days and use a custom format
  for (recurrent) appointments: ` - Some appointment (18:30 to 21:30)`.

`calcurse -t --format-todo '(%p) %m\n'`::
  List all todo items and put parentheses around the priority specifiers.

Extended format specifiers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Extended format specifiers can be used if you want to specify advanced
formatting options. Extended specifiers are introduced by `%(` and are
terminated by a closing parenthesis (`)`). The following list includes all
short specifiers and corresponding long options:

* `s`: `(start)`
* `S`: `(start:epoch)`
* `e`: `(end)`
* `E`: `(end:epoch)`
* `d`: `(duration)`
* `r`: `(remaining)`
* `m`: `(message)`
* `n`: `(noteid)`
* `N`: `(note)`
* `p`: `(priority)`

The `(start)` and `(end)` specifiers support strftime()-style extended
formatting options that can be used for fine-grained formatting. Additionally,
the special formats `epoch` (which is equivalent to `(start:%s)` or `(end:%s)`)
and `default` (which is mostly equivalent to `(start:%H:%M)` or `(end:%H:%M)`
but displays `..:..` if the item doesn't start/end at the current day) are
supported.

The `(remaining)` and `(duration)` specifiers support a subset of the
strftime()-style formatting options, along with two extra qualifiers.
The supported options are `%d`, `%H`, `%M` and `%S`, and by default each
of these is zero-padded to two decimal places. To avoid the
zero-padding, add `-` before the formatting option (for example, `%-d`).
Additionally, the `E` option will display the total number of time units
until the appointment, rather than showing the remaining number of time
units modulo the next larger time unit. For example, an appointment in
50 hours will show as 02:00 with the formatting string `%H:%M`, but will
show 50:00 with the formatting string `%EH:%M`. Note that if you are
combining the `-` and `E` options, the `-` must come first. The default
format for the `(remaining)` specifier is `%EH:%M`.

There are two additional long format specifiers that do not have any
corresponding short options. They can be used to print an item's hash or its
internal representation and were designed to be used for scripting:

* `(hash)`
* `(raw)`

[[basics_invocation_variable]]
Environment variable for i18n
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`calcurse` can be compiled with native language support (see
<<install_requirements_gettext,gettext library>>). Thus, if you wish to have
messages displayed into your native language, first make sure it is available
by looking at the `po/LINGUAS` file.  This file indicates the set of available
languages by showing the two-letters corresponding code (for example, *fr*
stands for french).  If you do not find your language, it would be greatly
appreciated if you could help translating `calcurse` (see the <<contribute,How
to contribute?>> section).

If your language is available, run `calcurse` with the following command:

----
$ LC_ALL=fr_FR calcurse
----

... where *fr_FR* is the locale name in this example, but should be replaced by
the locale corresponding to the desired language.

You should also specify the charset to be used, because in some cases the
accents and such are not displayed correctly.  This charset is indicated at the
beginning of the po file corresponding to the desired language. For instance,
you can see in the fr.po file that it uses the iso-8859-1 charset, so you could
run `calcurse` using the following command:

----
$ LC_ALL=fr_FR.ISO8859-1 calcurse
----

Other environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following environment variables affect the way `calcurse` operates:

`VISUAL`::
  Specifies the external editor to use for writing notes.

`EDITOR`::
  If the `VISUAL` environment variable is not set, then `EDITOR` will be used
  as the default external editor. If none of those variables are set, then
  `/usr/bin/vi` is used instead.

`PAGER`::
  Specifies the default viewer to be used for reading notes.  If this variable
  is not set, then `/usr/bin/less` is used.

See also <<basics_files,calcurse files>>.

Hooks
~~~~~

You can place scripts in `<confdir>/hooks/`
(see section <<basics_files,calcurse files>>) to trigger actions at certain
events. To enable a hook, add a script with one of the following names to this
directory. Also make sure the scripts are executable.

*pre-load*::
  Executed before the data files are loaded.
*post-load*::
  Executed after the data files are loaded.
*pre-save*::
  Executed before the data files are saved.
*post-save*::
  Executed after the data files are saved.

Some examples can be found in the `contrib/hooks/` directory of the calcurse
source tree.

User interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Non-interactive mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When called with at least one of the following arguments: `-a`, `-d`, `-h`,
`-n`, `-t`, `-v`, `-x`, `calcurse` is started in non-interactive mode.  This
means the desired information will be displayed, and after that, `calcurse`
simply quits and you are driven back to the shell prompt.

That way, one can add a line such as `calcurse --todo --appointment` in its
init config file to display at logon the list of tasks and appointments
scheduled for the current day.

[[basics_interface_interactive]]
Interactive mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: Key bindings that are indicated in this manual correspond to the default
      ones, defined when `calcurse` is launched for the first time. If those
      key bindings do not suit user's needs, it is possible to change them
      within the keys configuration menu (see <<options_keys,key bindings>>).

When called without any argument or only with the `-c` option, `calcurse` is
started in interactive mode. In this mode, you are shown an interface
containing three different panels which you can browse using the `TAB` key,
plus a notification bar and a status bar (see figure below).

----

The first panel represents a calendar which allows to highlight a particular
day, the second one contains the list of the events and appointments on that
day, and the last one contains a list of tasks to do but which are not assigned
to any specific day.

Depending on the selected view, the calendar could either display a monthly
(default as shown in previous figure) or weekly view.  The weekly view would
look like the following:

----

+------------------------------------+
----

The current week number is displayed on the top-right side of the panel (*# 13*
meaning it is the 13th week of the year in the above example). The seven days
of the current week are displayed in column. Each day is divided into slices of
4 hours each (6 slices in total, see figure above). A slice will appear in a
different color if an appointment falls into the corresponding time-slot.

In the appointment panel, one can notice the *`(|)`* sign just in front of the
date.  This indicates the current phase of the moon.  Depending on which is the
current phase, the following signs can be seen:

`  |) `::
  first quarter

` (|) `::
  full moon

`  (| `::
  last quarter

`  |  `::
  new moon

no sign::
  Phase of the moon does not correspond to any of the above ones.

At the very bottom of the screen there is a status bar, which indicates the
possible actions and the corresponding keystrokes.

Just above this status bar is the notify-bar, which indicates from left to
right : the current date, the current time, the calendar file currently in use
(apts on the above example, which is the default calendar file, see the
following section), and the next appointment within the upcoming 24 hours. Here
it says that it will be lunch time in one hour and twenty minutes.

NOTE: Some actions, such as editing or adding an item, require to type in some
      text. This is done with the help of the built-in input line editor.

Within this editor, if a line is longer than the screen width, a `>`, `*`, or
`<` character is displayed in the last column indicating that there are more
character after, before and after, or before the current position,
respectively. The line is scrolled horizontally as necessary.

Moreover, some editing commands are bound to particular control characters.
Hereafter are indicated the available editing commands (`^` stands for the
control key):

`^a`::
  moves the cursor to the beginning of the input line

`^b`::
  moves the cursor backward

`^d`::
  deletes one character forward

`^e`::
  moves the cursor to the end of the input line

`^f`::
  moves the cursor forward

`^h`::
  deletes one character backward

`^k`::
  deletes the input from the cursor to the end of the line

`^w`::
  deletes backward to the beginning of the current word

`ESCAPE`::
    cancels the editing

[[basics_daemon]]
Background mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the daemon mode is enabled in the notification configuration menu (see
<<options_notify,Notify-bar settings>>), `calcurse` will stay in background
when the user interface is not running. In background mode, `calcurse` checks
for upcoming appointments and runs the user-defined notification command when
  necessary. When the user interface is started again, the daemon automatically
  stops.

`calcurse` background activity can be logged (set the `daemon.log` variable in
the notification configuration <<options_notify,menu>>), and in that case,
information about the daemon start and stop time, reminders' command launch
time, signals received... will be written in the `daemon.log` file (see section
<<basics_files,files>>).

Using the `--status` command line option (see section
<<basics_invocation_commandline,Command line arguments>>), one can know if
`calcurse` is currently running in background or not.  If the daemon is
running, a message like the following one will be displayed (the pid of the
daemon process will be shown):

----
calcurse is running in background (pid 14536)
----

NOTE: To stop the daemon, just send the `TERM` signal to it, using a command
      such as: `kill daemon_pid`, where *daemon_pid* is the process id of the
      daemon (14536 in the above example).

[[basics_files]]
calcurse files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An alternative directory for 'both' the configuration files and the data
directory may be specified with the `-D` option.

An alternative directory for the configuration files 'only' may be specified
with the `-C` option; in that case data files are either in the default
directory or in the directory specified by `-D`. If both `-D` and `-C` are
present, configuration files in the data directory, if any, are ignored.

If +$HOME/.calcurse+ exists, then it will be used as the default for both the
data directory and the configuration directory.

----
<datadir>      <confdir>
     |             |
     |__ apts      |___ conf
     |__ todo      |___ keys
     |__ notes/    |___ hooks/

defaults:
     <datadir>: $XDG_DATA_HOME/calcurse ($HOME/.local/share/calcurse)
     <confdir>: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/calcurse ($HOME/.config/calcurse)
     both: $HOME/.calcurse (only if it exists)
----
`notes/`::
  this subdirectory contains descriptions of the notes which are attached to
  appointments, events or todos. Since the file name of each note file is a
  SHA1 hash of the note itself, multiple items can share the same note file.
  calcurse provides a garbage collector (see the `-g` command line parameter)
  that can be used to remove note files which are no longer linked to any item.
`apts`::
  this file contains  all  of the events and user's appointments
`todo`::
  this file contains the todo list
`conf`::
  this file contains the user configuration
`keys`::
  this file contains the user-defined key bindings
`hooks/`::
  this subdirectory contains scripts that you can use to trigger actions at
  certain events (see <<_hooks,Hooks>>)

NOTE: If the logging of calcurse daemon activity was set in the notification
      configuration menu, the extra file `daemon.log` will appear in the
      calcurse data directory. This file contains logs about calcurse activity
      when running in background.

Import/Export capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The import and export capabilities offered by `calcurse` are described below.

Import
^^^^^^

Data in icalendar format as described in the rfc2445 specification (see
<<links_others,links>> section below) can be imported into calcurse.  Calcurse
ical parser is based on version 2.0 of this specification, but for now on, only
a subset of it is supported.

The following icalendar properties are handled by calcurse:

* `VTODO` items: "PRIORITY", "VALARM", "SUMMARY", "DESCRIPTION"

* `VEVENT` items: "DTSTART", "DTEND", "DURATION", "RRULE", "EXDATE", "VALARM",
  "SUMMARY", "DESCRIPTION"

The icalendar `DESCRIPTION` property will be converted into calcurse format by
adding a note to the item. If a "VALARM" property is found, the item will be
flagged as important and the user will get a notification (this is only
applicable to appointments).

Here are the properties that are not implemented:

* negative time durations are not taken into account (item is skipped)

* some recurrence frequencies are not recognize: "SECONDLY" / "MINUTELY" /
  "HOURLY"

* some recurrence keywords are not recognized (all those starting with `BY`):
  "BYSECOND" / "BYMINUTE" / "BYHOUR" / "BYDAY" / "BYMONTHDAY" / "BYYEARDAY" /
  "BYWEEKNO" / "BYMONTH" / "BYSETPOS" plus "WKST"

* the recurrence exception keyword "EXRULE" is not recognized

* timezones are not taken into account

Export
^^^^^^

Two possible export formats are available: `ical` and `pcal` (see section
<<links_others,Links>> below to find out about those formats).

Online help
~~~~~~~~~~~

At any time, the built-in help system can be invoked by pressing the `?` key.
By default, it shows an introduction to the help system in an external pager.
You need to exit the pager in order to get back to calcurse (pressing `q`
should almost always work). The default pager can be changed by setting the
PAGER environment variable.

If you want to display help on a specific feature or key binding, type `:help
<feature>` (e.g. `:help add`) or `:help <key>` (e.g. `:help ^A`) on the main
screen.

Options
-------

All of the `calcurse` parameters are configurable from the Configuration menu
available when pressing `C`. You are then driven to a submenu with five
possible choices : pressing `C` again will lead you to the Color scheme
configuration, pressing `L` allows you to choose the layout of the main
`calcurse` screen (in other words, where to put the three different panels on
screen), pressing `G` permits you to choose between different general options,
pressing `K` opens the key bindings configuration menu, and last you can modify
the notify-bar settings by pressing `N`.

[[options_general]]
General options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options control `calcurse` general behavior, as described below:

`appearance.compactpanels` (default: *no*)::
  In compact panels mode, all captions are removed from panels.

`appearance.defaultpanel` (default: *calendar*)::
  This can be used to specify the panel to be selected on startup.

`general.autosave` (default: *yes*)::
  This option allows to automatically save the user's data (if set to *yes*)
  when quitting.  <p class="rq"><span class="valorise">warning:</span> No data
  will be automatically saved if `general.autosave` is set to *no*.  This means
  the user must press `S` (for saving) in order to retrieve its modifications.

`general.autogc` (default: *no*)::
  Automatically run the garbage collector for note files when quitting.

`general.periodicsave` (default: *0*)::
  If different from `0`, user's data will be automatically saved every
  *general.periodicsave* minutes.  When an automatic save is performed, two
  asterisks (i.e. `**`) will appear on the top right-hand side of the screen).

`general.confirmquit` (default: *yes*)::
  If set to *yes*, confirmation is required before quitting, otherwise pressing
  `Q` will cause `calcurse` to quit without prompting for user confirmation.

`general.confirmdelete` (default: *yes*)::
  If this option is set to *yes*, pressing `D` for deleting an item (either a
  *todo*, *appointment*, or *event*), will lead to a prompt asking for user
  confirmation before removing the selected item from the list.  Otherwise, no
  confirmation will be needed before deleting the item.

`general.systemdialogs` (default: *yes*)::
  Setting this option to *no* will result in skipping the system dialogs
  related to the saving and loading of data.  This can be useful to speed up
  the input/output processes.

`general.progressbar` (default: *yes*)::
  If set to *no*, this will cause the disappearing of the progress bar which is
  usually shown when saving data to file.  If set to *yes*, this bar will be
  displayed, together with the name of the file being saved (see section
  <<basics_files,calcurse files>>).

`appearance.calendarview` (default: *0*)::
  If set to `0`, the monthly calendar view will be displayed by default
  otherwise it is the weekly view that will be displayed.

`general.firstdayofweek` (default: *monday*)::
  One can choose between Monday and Sunday as the first day of the week. If
  `general.firstdayofweek` is set to *monday*, Monday will be first in the
  calendar view. Otherwise, Sunday will be the first day of the week.

`format.outputdate` (default: *%D*)::
  This option indicates the format to be used when displaying dates in
  non-interactive mode. Using the default values, dates are displayed the
  following way: *mm/dd/aa*.  You can see all of the possible formats by typing
  `man 3 strftime` inside a terminal.

`format.inputdate` (default: *1*)::
  This option indicates the format that will be used to enter dates in
  interactive mode. Four choices are available:
+
1. mm/dd/yyyy
2. dd/mm/yyyy
3. yyyy/mm/dd
4. yyyy-mm-dd

[[options_keys]]
Key bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

One can define ones own key bindings within the `Keys` configuration menu. The
default keys look like the one used by the `vim` editor, especially the
displacement keys. Anyway, within this configuration menu, users can redefine
all of the keys available from within calcurse's user interface.

To define new key bindings, first highlight the action to which it will apply.
Then, delete the actual key binding if necessary, and add a new one. You will
then be asked to press the key corresponding to the new binding. It is possible
to define more than one key binding for a single action.

An automatic check is performed to see if the new key binding is not already
set for another action. In that case, you will be asked to choose a different
one. Another check is done when exiting from this menu, to make sure all
possible actions have a key associated with it.

The following keys can be used to define bindings:

* lower-case, upper-case letters and numbers, such as `a`, `Z`, `0`

* CONTROL-key followed by one of the above letters

* escape, horizontal tab, and space keys

* arrow keys (up, down, left, and right)

* `HOME` and `END` keys

While inside the key configuration menu, an online help is available for each
one of the available actions. This help briefly describes what the highlighted
action is used for.

NOTE: As of calcurse 3.0.0, displacement commands can be preceded by an
      optional number to repeat the command. For example, `10k` will move the
      cursor ten weeks forwards if you use default key bindings.

Color themes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`calcurse` color theme can be customized to suit user's needs. To change the
default theme, the configuration page displays possible choices for foreground
and background colors.  Using arrows or calcurse displacement keys to move, and
`X` or space to select a color, user can preview the theme which will be
applied.  It is possible to keep the terminal's default colors by selecting the
corresponding choice in the list.

The chosen color theme will then be applied to the panel borders, to the
titles, to the keystrokes, and to general information displayed inside status
bar. A black and white theme is also available, in order to support non-color
terminals.

NOTE: Depending on your terminal type and on the value of the `$TERM`
      environment variable, color could or could not be supported. An error
      message will appear if you try to change colors whereas your terminal
      does not support this feature.  If you do know your terminal supports
      colors but could not get `calcurse` to display them, try to set your
      `$TERM` variable to another value (such as *xterm-xfree86* for instance).

Layout configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The layout corresponds to the position of the panels inside `calcurse` screen.
The default layout makes the calendar panel to be displayed on the top-right
corner of the terminal, the todo panel on the bottom-right corner, while the
appointment panel is displayed on the left hand-side of the screen (see the
figure in section <<basics_interface_interactive,Interactive mode>> for an
example of the default layout).  By choosing another layout in the
configuration screen, user can customize `calcurse` appearance to best suit his
needs by placing the different panels where needed.

The following option is used to modify the layout configuration:

`appearance.layout` (default: *0*)::
  Eight different layouts are to be chosen from (see layout configuration
  screen for the description of the available layouts).

Sidebar configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sidebar is the part of the screen which contains two panels: the calendar
and, depending on the chosen layout, either the todo list or the appointment
list.

The following option is used to change the width of the sidebar:

`appearance.sidebarwidth` (default: *0*)::
  Width (in percentage, 0 being the minimum width) of the side bar.

[[options_notify]]
Notify-bar settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following options are used to modify the notify-bar behavior:

`appearance.notifybar` (default: *yes*)::
  This option indicates if you want the notify-bar to be displayed or not.

`format.notifydate` (default: *%a %F*)::
  With this option, you can specify the format to be used to display the
  current date inside the notification bar. You can see all of the possible
  formats by typing `man 3 strftime` inside a terminal.

`format.notifytime` (default: *%T*)::
  With this option, you can specify the format to be used to display the
  current time inside the notification bar. You can see all of the possible
  formats by typing `man 3 strftime` inside a terminal.

`notification.warning` (default: *300*)::
  When there is an appointment which is flagged as `important` within the next
  `notification.warning` seconds, the display of that appointment inside the
  notify-bar starts to blink. Moreover, the command defined by the
  `notification.command` option will be launched.  That way, the user is warned
  and knows there will be soon an upcoming appointment.

`notification.command` (default: *printf '\a'*)::
  This option indicates which command is to be launched when there is an
  upcoming appointment flagged as `important`. This command will be passed to
  the user's shell which will interpret it. To know what shell must be used,
  the content of the `$SHELL` environment variable is used. If this variable is
  not set, `/bin/sh` is used instead.
+
====
Say the `mail` command is available on the user's system, one can use the
following command to get notified by mail of an upcoming appointment (the
appointment description will also be mentioned in the mail body):

----
$ calcurse --next | mail -s "[calcurse] upcoming appointment!" user@host.com
----
====

`notification.notifyall` (default: *flagged-only*)::
  If set to flagged-only, you are only notified of flagged items. If set to
  unflagged-only, you are only notified of unflagged items. If set to all,
  notifications are always sent, independent of whether an item is flagged or
  not. For historical reasons, this option also accepts boolean values where
  yes equals flagged-only and no equals unflagged-only.

`daemon.enable` (default: *no*)::
  If set to yes, daemon mode will be enabled, meaning `calcurse` will run into
  background when the user's interface is exited. This will allow the
  notifications to be launched even when the interface is not running. More
  details can be found in section <<basics_daemon,Background mode>>.

`daemon.log` (default: *no*)::
  If set to yes, `calcurse` daemon activity will be logged (see section
  <<basics_files,files>>).

Known bugs
----------

Incorrect highlighting of items appear when using calcurse black and white
theme together with a `$TERM` variable set to *xterm-color*.  To fix this bug,
and as advised by Thomas E. Dickey (`xterm` maintainer), *xterm-xfree86* should
be used instead of *xterm-color* to set the `$TERM` variable:

____
"The xterm-color value for $TERM is a bad choice for XFree86 xterm because it
is commonly used for a `terminfo` entry which happens to not support bce. Use
the xterm-xfree86 entry which is distributed with XFree86 xterm (or the similar
one distributed with ncurses)."

[[bugs]]
Reporting bugs and feedback
---------------------------

Please send bug reports and feedback to: `misc .at. calcurse .dot. org`.

[[contribute]]
How to contribute?
------------------

If you would like to contribute to the project, you can first send your
feedback on what you like or dislike, and if there are features you miss in
`calcurse`.  For now on, possible contributions concern the translation of
`calcurse` messages and documentation.

Translating documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: We recently dropped all translations of the manual files from the
      distribution tarball. There are plan to reintroduce them in form of a
      Wiki on the calcurse website. Please follow the mailing lists for
      up-to-date information.

The *doc/* directory of the source package already contains translated version
of `calcurse` manual. However, if the manual is not yet available into your
native language, it would be appreciated if you could help translating it.

To do so, just copy one of the existing manual file to `manual_XX.html`, where
*XX* identifies your language. Then translate this newly created file and send
it to the author (see <<bugs,Reporting bugs and feedback>>), so that it can be
included in the next `calcurse` release.

calcurse i18n
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As already mentioned, `gettext` utilities are used by `calcurse` to produce
multi-lingual messages. We are currently using
http://www.transifex.net/[Transifex] to manage those translations.

This section provides information about how to translate those messages into
your native language. However, this howto is deliberately incomplete, focusing
on working with `gettext` for `calcurse` specifically.  For more comprehensive
information or to grasp the Big Picture of Native Language Support, you should
refer to the `GNU gettext` manual at:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/

IMPORTANT: Since we switched to Transifex, editing *po* files is not necessary
           anymore as Transifex provides a user-friendly, intuitive web
           interface for translators. Knowledge of `gettext` and the *po*
           format is still useful for those of you who prefer the command line
           and local editing. If you want to use the web UI to edit the
           translation strings, you can skip over to <<transifex_webui,Using
           the Transifex web UI>> tough.

Basically, three different people get involved in the translation chain:
coders, language coordinator, and translators. After a quick overview of how
things work, the translator tasks will be described hereafter.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

To be able to display texts in the native language of the user, two steps are
required: *internationalization* (i18n) and *localization* (l10n).

i18n is about making `calcurse` support multiple languages. It is performed by
coders, who will mark translatable texts and provide a way to display them
translated at runtime.

l10n is about making the i18n'ed `calcurse` adapt to the specific language of
the user, ie translating the strings previously marked by the developers, and
setting the environment correctly for `calcurse` to use the result of this
translation.

So, translatable strings are first marked by the coders within the `C` source
files, then gathered in a template file (*calcurse.pot* - the *pot* extension
meaning *portable object template*). The content of this template file is then
merged with the translation files for each language (*fr.po* for French, for
instance - with *po* standing for *portable object*, ie meant to be read and
edited by humans). A given translation team will take this file, translate its
strings, and send it back to the developers. At compilation time, a binary
version of this file (for efficiency reasons) will be produced (*fr.mo* - *mo*
stands for *machine object*, i.e. meant to be read by programs), and then
installed.  Then `calcurse` will use this file at runtime, translating the
strings according to the locale settings of the user.

Translator tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose someone wants to initiate the translation of a new language. Here are
the steps to follow:

* First, find out what the locale name is. For instance, for french, it is
  `fr_FR`, or simply `fr`. This is the value the user will have to put in his
  `LC_ALL` environment variable for software to be translated (see
  <<basics_invocation_variable,Environment variable for i18n>>).

* Then, go into the *po/* directory, and create a new po-file
  from the template file using the following command: `msginit -i calcurse.pot
  -o fr.po -l fr --no-translator` If you do not have `msginit` installed on
  your system, simply copy the *calcurse.pot* file to *fr.po* and edit the
  header by hand.

Now, having this *fr.po* file, the translator is ready to begin.

po-files
^^^^^^^^

The format of the po-files is quite simple. Indeed, po-files are made of four
things:

1. *location lines:* tells you where the strings can be seen (name of file and
   line number), in case you need to see a bit of context.

2. *msgid lines:* the strings to translate.

3. *msgstr lines:* the translated strings.

4. *lines prefixed with `#`:* comments (some with a special meaning, as we will
   see below).

Basically, all you have to do is fill the *msgstr* lines with the translation
of the above *msgid* line.

A few notes:

*Fuzzy strings*::
  You will meet strings marked with a `"#, fuzzy"` comment. `calcurse` won't
  use the translations of such strings until you do something about them.  A
  string being fuzzy means either that the string has already been translated
  but has since been changed in the sources of the program, or that this is a
  new string for which `gettext` made a 'wild guess' for the translation, based
  on other strings in the file.  It means you have to review the translation.
  Sometimes, the original string has changed just because a typo has been
  fixed. In this case, you won't have to change anything. But sometimes, the
  translation will no longer be accurate and needs to be changed.  Once you are
  done and happy with the translation, just remove the `"#, fuzzy"` line, and
  the translation will be used again in `calcurse`.

*c-format strings and special sequences*::
  Some strings have the following comment: `"#, c-format"`.  This tells that
  parts of the string to translate have a special meaning for the program, and
  that you should leave them alone.  For instance, %-sequences, like `"%s"`.
  These means that `calcurse` will replace them with another string. So it is
  important it remains.  There are also \-sequences, like `\n` or `\t`. Leave
  them, too. The former represents an end of line, the latter a tabulation.

*Translations can be wrapped*::
  If lines are too long, you can just break them like this:
+
----
msgid ""
"some very long line"
"another line"
----

*po-file header*::
  At the very beginning of the po-file, the first string form a header, where
  various kind of information has to be filled in. Most important one is the
  charset. It should resemble
+
----
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n"
----
+
You should also fill in the Last-Translator field, so that potential
contributors can contact you if they want to join you in the translation team,
or have remarks/typo fixes to give about the translations. You can either just
give your name/nick, or add an email address, for example:
+
----
"Last-Translator: Frederic Culot <frederic@culot.org>\n"
----

*Comments*::
  Adding comments (lines beginning with the `#` character) can be a good way to
  point out problems or translation difficulties to proofreaders or other
  members of your team.

*Strings size*::
  `calcurse` is a curses/console program, thus it can be heavily dependent on
  the terminal size (number of columns). You should think about this when
  translating. Often, a string must fit into a single line (standard length is
  80 characters). Don't translate blindly, try to look where your string will
  be displayed to adapt your translation.

*A few useful tools*::
  The po-file format is very simple, and the file can be edited with a standard
  text editor.  But if you prefer, there are few specialized tools you may find
  convenient for translating:
+
* `poEdit` (http://www.poedit.org/)
* `KBabel` (http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/)
* `GTranslator` (http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net/)
* `Emacs` po mode
* `Vim` po mode

*And finally*::
  I hope you'll have fun contributing to a more internationalized world. :) If
  you have any more questions, don't hesitate to contact us at *misc .at.

[[transifex_uploading]]
Uploading to Transifex
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There's several different ways to upload a finished (or semi-finished)
translation for a new language to Transifex. The easiest way is to browse to
the http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/calcurse/teams/[Translation Teams] page
and request the addition of a new team.

As soon as we accepted your request, you will be able to upload your *po* file
on the
http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/calcurse/resource/calcursepot/[calcurse
resource page] by clicking the *Add translation* button at the bottom.

Using transifex-client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also use a command line client to submit translations instead of having
to use the web interface every time you want to submit an updated version. If
you have a recent version of `setuptools` installed, you can get the CLI client
by issuing the following command:

----
$ easy_install -U transifex-client
----

Alternatively, you can get the source code of transifex-client at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transifex-client.

After you downloaded and installed the client, run the following commands in
the calcurse source directory to checkout the translation resources of
*calcurse*:

----
$ tx pull -a
----

To submit changes back to the server, use:

----
$ tx push -r calcurse.calcursepot -t -l <locale>
----

For more details, read up on `transifex-client` usage at the
http://help.transifex.net/user-guide/client/[The Transifex Command-line Client
v0.4] section of the http://help.transifex.net/[Transifex documentation].

[[transifex_webui]]
Using the Transifex web UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an alternative to editing *po* files, there is a web-based interface that
can be used to create and update translations. After having signed up and
created a new translation team (see <<transifex_uploading,Uploading to
Transifex>> on how to do that), click the *Add translation* button at the
bottom on the
http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/calcurse/resource/calcursepot/[calcurse
resource page], select the language you'd like to translate and choose
*Translate Online*.
