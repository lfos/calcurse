Flag Item
=========

Toggle an appointment's 'important' flag or a todo's 'completed' flag.  If a
todo is flagged as completed, its priority number will be inverted/made
negative and it will disappear from the list. Completed tasks will no longer
appear in exported data or when using the '-t' command line flag (unless
specifying '0' as the priority number, in which case only completed tasks will
be shown).

If an appointment is flagged as important, an exclamation mark appears in front
of it, and you will be warned if time gets close to the appointment start time.

To customize the way one gets notified, the configuration submenu lets you
choose the command launched to warn user of an upcoming appointment, and how
long before it he gets notified.
