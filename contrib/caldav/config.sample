# If you want to synchronize calcurse with a CalDAV server using
# calcurse-caldav, create a new directory at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/calcurse/caldav/
# (~/.config/calcurse/caldav/) and $XDG_DATA_HOME/calcurse/caldav/
# (~/.local/share/calcurse/caldav/) and copy this file to
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/calcurse/caldav/config and adjust the configuration below.
# Alternatively, if using ~/.calcurse, create a new directory at
# ~/.calcurse/caldav/ and copy this file to ~/.calcurse/caldav/config and adjust
# the configuration file below.

[General]
# Path to the calcurse binary that is used for importing/exporting items.
Binary = calcurse

# Host name of the server that hosts CalDAV.
Hostname = some.hostname.com

# Path to the CalDAV calendar on the host specified above.
Path = /path/to/calendar/on/the/server/

# Type of authentication to use. Must be "basic" or "oauth2"
#AuthMethod = basic

# Enable this if you want to skip SSL certificate checks.
InsecureSSL = No

# Disable this if you want to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
# Using plain HTTP is highly discouraged.
HTTPS = Yes

# This option allows you to filter the types of tasks synced. To this end, the
# value of this option should be a comma-separated list of item types, where
# each item type is either "event", "apt", "recur-event", "recur-apt", "todo",
# "recur" or "cal". Note that the comma-separated list must not contain any
# spaces. Refer to the documentation of the --filter-type command line argument
# of calcurse for more details. Set this option to "cal" if the configured
# CalDAV server doesn't support tasks, such as is the case with Google
# Calendar.
SyncFilter = cal,todo

# Disable this option to actually enable synchronization. If it is enabled,
# nothing is actually written to the server or to the local data files. If you
# combine DryRun = Yes with Verbose = Yes, you get a log of what would have
# happened with this option disabled.
DryRun = Yes

# Enable this if you want detailed logs written to stdout.
Verbose = Yes

# Credentials for HTTP Basic Authentication. Leave this commented out if you do
# not want to use authentication.
#[Auth]
#Username = user
#Password = pass

# Optionally specify additional HTTP headers here.
#[CustomHeaders]
#User-Agent = Mac_OS_X/10.9.2 (13C64) CalendarAgent/176

# Use the following to synchronize with an OAuth2-based service
# such as Google Calendar.
#[OAuth2]
#ClientID = your_client_id
#ClientSecret = your_client_secret

# Scope of access for API calls. Synchronization requires read/write.
#Scope = https://example.com/resource/scope

# Change the redirect URI if you receive errors, but ensure that it is identical
# to the redirect URI you specified in the API settings.
#RedirectURI = http://127.0.0.1
