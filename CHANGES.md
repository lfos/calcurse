--------------------------

- New features:

    * Support any weekday as first day of week; previously, only Sunday and

      free on import errors. Fix parsing of UNTIL.

    * Do not remove an empty note file after edit session.

    * Keep internal linked list sorted when moving items.

    * Prevent external hook/notification commands from interacting with the UI.

- calcurse-caldav bug fixes:

    * Allow non-ASCII characters in username and password (fixed by Henrik

      reported as errors instead of ignored.

      characters that need to be URL-encoded (reported and fixed by Max
      Deineko).

Version 4.7.0 (2020-10-12)
--------------------------

- Compatibility notes:

    * Note file contents are now exported as DESCRIPTION in iCal exports. For
      notes that should not be exported, please use the "-- " separator
      (dash-dash-space-newline); everything below that separator (including the
      separator itself) is ignored during export.

    * The item deletion menu has been redesigned and now looks as follows:

          Delete (s)elected occurrence, (a)ll occurrences, or only the (n)ote?

      Options that are not available (e.g. because the item is not recurrent
      or does not have a note) are omitted.

    * The systemdialogs option has been removed from the configuration. The
      welcome window has been removed, import/export status messages are now
      always displayed unless the --quiet command line flag is used.

- New features:

    * Support for advanced recurrence rules (e.g. "every year on last Sunday in
      October"). Supported in the UI and in iCal imports. For details on how to
      use advanced recurrences, run :help repeat. Sample iCal files with
      advanced recurrence rules can be found in contrib/import/ in the calcurse
      source tree.

    * Repeat counts are accepted in the UI as an alternative to repetition end
      dates for recurrent items (e.g. "#3" to specify that an item should have
      three occurrences).

    * The :previous and :next commands can be used to jump to the previous/next
      occurrence of the currently selected recurrent item. This is useful for
      verifying that a new (advanced) recurrence rule works as intended.

    * Various improvements in iCal imports: Location, comment and status of
      iCal events are now imported as special fields in the note file. The time
      zone identifier (TZID) is now recognized, time fields are converted to a
      local time and the zone identifier is logged in the note file.

    * Notes are now displayed in the item view dialog (implemented by Ambika
      Eshwar).

- Bug fixes:

    * Fixed formatting of DTSTART for recurrent events (implemented by
      Jerem-K).

    * Improvements in hook execution. Hooks are background jobs and must not
      interfere with the terminal (stdin, stdout, stderr).

- calcurse-caldav bug fixes:

    * Checks to make sure the config and data dirs exist (implemented by
      Nitroretro).

Version 4.6.0 (2020-03-27)
--------------------------

- New features:

    * XDG base directory support: While using ~/.calcurse/ is still supported
      for backwards compatibility, we recommend putting your configuration
      files in ~/.config/calcurse/ and your data files in
      ~/.local/share/calcurse/ instead (implemented by Nitroretro).

    * Configurable text for empty days (implemented by Lars Henriksen).

    * Support RET to set the todo item priority to 0 (implemented by Issam

      There are five new configuration variables: one that turns the feature
      on/off and four that affect the number of lines used by each day and with
      it the number of days on display.

    * Experimental vdir support: The calcurse distribution tarball now includes
      an experimental script called calcurse-vdir that can be used as an
      alternative to calurse-caldav (implemented by vxid). For details, please
      refer to contrib/vdir/README.md in the calcurse source tree.

      Henriksen).

      environment variables to override the default editor, pager and merge
      tool.

    * Several improvements to the reload and save routines. The save routine
      now detects external changes to the data files and no longer blindly
      overwrites data which was edited externally. In case of external changes,
      different options are offered, one of them being the execution of the
      merge tool to merge external changes and changes done from the running
      calcurse instance.  The reload routine also no longer performs a reload
      if both the external data files and the local data are unchanged.

    * Several improvements to the CalDAV synchronization script, including
      OAuth2 support and instructions on how to synchronize calcurse with
      Google Calendar (requested and implemented by Randy Ramos).

      synchronization script (suggested by azarus and implemented by Randy
      Ramos).

      "extended recurrent events" such as events occurring on the third
      Thursday of each month.

- Bug fixes:

    * Gracefully parse iCal parameters with colons (reported by Hakan Jerning).

    * Fixes to the notification feature affecting recurrent appointments
      (reported by rgc69).

      Maximiliano Redigonda).

    * Proper ISO 8601 week numbering (reported and fixed by Lars Henriksen).

    * The delete key no longer acts as backspace (reported by Zekario and fixed
      by cryptolmath).

      Henriksen).

      the calcurse source tree.

    * Experimental CalDAV support: The calcurse distribution tarball now
      includes an experimental script called calcurse-caldav that can be used
      to synchronize calcurse with your mobile devices or any other computer.
      For details, please refer to contrib/caldav/README in the calcurse source
      tree.
