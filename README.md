## Installation

calcurse is available on a number of Linux distributions:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/calcurse.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/calcurse/versions)

## Building from Source

Install the following build dependencies. If your distribution segments
development files from core packages (i.e., \*-devel or \*-dev packages), you
may need to install those as well:

* gcc
* autoconf-archive
* automake
* autopoint
* asciidoc (only needed for building documentation, can be skipped with --disable-docs)
* gettext with development files
* ncurses with development files

If you are using a release tarball, the following commands can be used to build
and install calcurse:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

Note that `make install` needs to be run as root. When working on a Git
checkout, you need to run `./autogen.sh` before `./configure`.

## Source Overview

* `build-aux`: auxiliary files for the build process
* `contrib`: useful tools such as hooks or the CalDAV synchronization script
* `doc`: detailed documentation in plain text and HTML
* `po`: translations and i18n-related files
* `scripts`: additional official scripts, such as `calcurse-upgrade`
